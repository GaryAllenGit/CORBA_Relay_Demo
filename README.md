Two CORBA demos that show how to code a "relay", i.e. a piece of code that acts as both a client
and a server at the same time.

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield.


Each demo has a client, a relay, and a server.  The client calls the relay, the relay calls the sever, the
server responds back to the relay, then the relay responds back to the client.

The RelayDemo runs from a command line with no GUI.

The RelayWithGUIsDemo is exactly the same, but each component also runs in a GUI (a Java JFrame).

The components of the two demos could be mixed and matched.
