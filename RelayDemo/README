Demo of a "relay" - i.e. a client and server at the same time (using IOR in file trick).


To run the demo from IntelliJ simply open the project, open a (IntelliJ) Terminal and type:

    cd RelayDemo/src
    idlj -fall Relay.idl

You can then run the different components of the system.  You need to start them in the following order:

    RelayServer
    Relay
    RelayClient


To run the demo from a command line:

1. precompile IDL.  Do this either from a command line with:

	idlj -fall Relay.idl

2. Compile the code with:

	javac *.java ClientAndServer/*.java

3. start server:

	java RelayServer

4. in another command tool, start the relay:

    java Relay

5. in another command tool, start the client:

	java RelayClient


The client will produce output similar to the following:

Calling relay...
Result =
Hello world !!
